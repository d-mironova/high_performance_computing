# High Performance Computing 

This is a repository for the projects I completed related to high performance computing. The running instructions are stated in report files in the corresponding project directory.

## Course Overview

This repository contains my projects and exercises for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) course. The course covers:

- **Linux Programming Tools**: Compilation, make utility, debugging, and profiling.
- **Code Optimization**: Techniques to optimize code for performance.
- **Parallel Computing Concepts**: Understanding the theory behind parallel computing.
- **Message Passing**: Writing parallel programs that communicate via message passing.
- **Thread-based Parallelization**: Developing programs that leverage multi-threading for parallel processing.
